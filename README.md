Web Technology Project for Sem 5

Overview:

The website can be used by an individual to view recipes of the food dishes that can be prepared using the ingredients that have been entered by him. The benefit of the website is the easy working of the website as well as a good user interface. The main goal is to provide a smooth and transparent experience to the individual. The website also allows the user to manage his favourite recipes and view a blog containing news related to food items that has been built on inputs from other users and also contribute to the same. With this platform, we aim at building a system providing the necessary information needed for cooking.
 
 
 Website Features:
 
  •	The website contains an index page which provides a new user a form to register himself and existing users a form to log-in to their account. 
  
  •	On login, the user is directed to a page wherein he can enter the ingredients he would like to use and get the suggested food dishes based on his input. The user can browse through these dishes, click on the links to get the additional information and entire recipes for the same and add a dish that he likes to his favourites for later viewing. 
  
  •	A Favourites page lists all the dishes that the user has added and also provides the functionality to remove the dish from his favourites.
  
  •	A Blog has been included that displays articles that have been added by other users. These articles can be viewed by people even without having an account. But to contribute their own articles to the blog, a user has to log-in to his account.
  
  •	The articles that have been submitted by users are viewed by an admin. The role of the admin is to review the articles and decide whether the article should be added to the blog for others to view or it should be discarded.
  
  •	User can also report an article as inappropriate or spam. User can report an article only once. Once the spam count for an article reaches a particular limit, it will automatically deleted from the database and no longer be available for viewing on the blog.
  
  •	The website also has a ‘Contact us’ page which includes the developer’s contact numbers, email-id of the website so that the users can mail their feedback and also the address of the company office.
